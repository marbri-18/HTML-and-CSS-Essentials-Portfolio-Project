Portfolio project for Code Institute course: Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications)

<h1>TINTOON</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p> The Tintoon website promotes a fictional Tintop App. The Tintoon App is a spoof version of the Tinder dating app. On Tintoon the human target audience is replaced by popular cartoon characters. The purpose of the web-site is to sell the Tintoon application to potential users so they are encouraged to Download the Tintoon App, Subscribe for a pricing plan or failing that register their details so they can be informed of future promotions and marketing information.</p>

<p> The Tintoon website consists of three pages. The Homepage (index.html) is a landing page with a header/banner section, a features section, a price plan section and a download section. The Gallery page (gallery.html) displays a collage of testimonials of previous satisfied customers in the form of figures. The sign Up page (sign_up.html) includes a form for users to register their details and in doing so be subscribed to receive special custom offers.</p>

<p>
The Tintoon web-site is based on a walkthrough project I completed in 2021 for a Udemy course I was learning on. The Course was called 2021 Web Development Bootcamp and was facilitated by Angela Yu of the App Brewery. The original walkthrough project was called Tindog and was similarly based on the Tinder App. The Tindog project was a single landing page with four sections. It was a project for learning the use of Bootstrap. At the time of completing the project, I exchanged the Dog dating theme for a Cartoon Character dating theme. For completing the HTML and CSS Essentials Portfolio Project 1, I thought it would be a valuable learning outcome for me to recreate the Tintoon website while not relying on Bootstrap but to create the visual appearance using only CSS. I have also extended the site to three pages including a Gallery and Sign Up page. The digital illustrations of well known Warner Brothers cartoon characters were all created and formatted for use on the website by myself using Affinity Designer.
